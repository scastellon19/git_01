In the forest deep where shadows play,  
Whispers of the pines sway and sway.  
The moonlight falls in silver beams,  
Stitching the night with threads of dreams.  
  
Owls call softly from their perch,  
Guardians of this ancient church.  
Each leaf a page in nature's tome,  
Each rustle a story of its own.  
  
The brook hums low, a lullaby,  
To stars reflected in the sky.  
Pebbles dance in waters clear,  
Echoes of a world so near.  
  
Beneath the branches, secrets hide,  
Tales of creatures far and wide.  
A fox's den, a rabbit's warren,  
Life weaves its tapestry unwoven.  
  
Fireflies dot the dusky air,  
Like scattered jewels beyond compare.  
Their glow a promise, soft and fleeting,  
A moment's magic, worth repeating.  
  
And in this realm of dark and light,  
Day's end and birth of night,  
We find a peace, a quiet grace,  
A whisper in this sacred space.  
  
For here, amidst the pines' embrace,  
We catch a glimpse of nature's face.  
A fleeting glance, a silent nod,  
To the quiet beauty of the wild facade.
