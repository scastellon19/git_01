## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

How doth the little crocodile   

Improve his shining tail,

And pour the waters of the Nile   

On every golden scale!   

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
And sorry I could not travel both  
And be one traveler, long I stood  
And looked down one as far as I could  
To where it bent in the undergrowth;  

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

"The sun was shining on the sea,  
      Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
      The billows smooth and bright —  
And this was odd, because it was  
      The middle of the night.  
  
The moon was shining sulkily,  
      Because she thought the sun  
Had got no business to be there  
      After the day was done —  
"It's very rude of him," she said,  
      "To come and spoil the fun."  
      
## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
In the forest deep where shadows play,  
Whispers of the pines sway and sway.  
The moonlight falls in silver beams,  
Stitching the night with threads of dreams.  
  
Owls call softly from their perch,  
Guardians of this ancient church.  
Each leaf a page in nature's tome,  
Each rustle a story of its own.  
  
The brook hums low, a lullaby,  
To stars reflected in the sky.  
Pebbles dance in waters clear,  
Echoes of a world so near.  
  
Beneath the branches, secrets hide,  
Tales of creatures far and wide.  
A fox's den, a rabbit's warren,  
Life weaves its tapestry unwoven.  
  
Fireflies dot the dusky air,  
Like scattered jewels beyond compare.  
Their glow a promise, soft and fleeting,  
A moment's magic, worth repeating.  
  
And in this realm of dark and light,  
Day's end and birth of night,  
We find a peace, a quiet grace,  
A whisper in this sacred space.  
  
For here, amidst the pines' embrace,  
We catch a glimpse of nature's face.  
A fleeting glance, a silent nod,  
To the quiet beauty of the wild facade.
